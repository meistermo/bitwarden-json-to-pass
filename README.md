# bitwarden-json-to-pass
A utility script to import Bitwarden database entries to pass, the standard unix password manager.

### About

I wrote this in a pinch when I was transitioning back from using a self-hosted Bitwarden instance to manage my passwords. There were quite a few entries and I didnt want to import them to **pass** one by one. I also wanted them to be in a very specific format when I was done. **This is what this software does.** Please do not expect me to update this software or change it in any way to fit your needs. You can do that yourself if you'd like. 

Eventually, I might update this software to be more convenient to use. For now though, I intend to leave it the way it is.
